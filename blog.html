        <h3>"If a Man Knows Not to Which Port He Sails, No Wind is Favorable"</h3>
        <p>Adversaries in every direction.</p>
        <p>Support has dissolved into hate.</p>
        <p>Why do the ones who want the best for us seem so dead-set on making it harder for us to achieve? 
           Why does the absence of parental validation weigh so heavily on our shoulders? Is it our fault for craving it, or their fault for not giving it to us?
           Why is it specifically <em>their</em> validation that seems paramount? And why do I give so much of a shit about it?
        </p>
        <p>
            As a child I never got much attention. The middle child who required the least amount of attention became the child who received the least. Hours, alone in my room, 
            working on whatever I was working on, whether it was Lego creations, video game modding, programming, or writing music. None of my parents seemed to have the patience
            to care. I spent years in that lonely bedroom, rarely even a "goodnight" before everyone went to bed. I felt like a recluse, but I didn't want to be. I wanted to share,
            but no one wanted to listen. So I worked on my things, whatever they were at the time. No one ever cared to ask me about them, no one asked me how they worked. Any 
            excitement about a project would be met by a tired, irritated, as if I was always a bother, "That's cool Joe".
        </p>
        <p>
            This was likely not good for me. Now I feel as if no one wants to hear me speak. As if no one gives a <em>shit</em>. As if the very utterance about the interesting
            topic I'm <em>dying</em> to discuss would be met with irritation and eye rolling. Why does no one want to hear what I have to say? 
        </p>
        <p>
            So this is my secret little place. Where I can say <em>what I want to say, whenever I want to say it</em>. It's technically public, but so obscure that it should rarely
            be found. If you've found this place, do what you will. This place is my little corner of the internet, a dark and terrible place indeed, but it is the frontier of our own
            creation. May we never tame its enchanted forests and cruel oceans.
